## Usage

> Examples of usage can be seen here:
https://github.com/nikhilsmehta/WikiBot/tree/master/Examples

>In essence, you need to first put a +symbol and then directly followed by the article you want to look up. So for example, if I wanted to look up Tom Brady i would do "+Tom Brady" The bot will then respond with an embed that has the article title, a short description and the article link. 

> To add this bot to your server, simply click on this link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=817064791750737970&permissions=8&scope=bot and select the server you want to add it to. Then, you are ready to use it!
